		<div class="Text">
			<p> My name is Felix Shaw Sparacino, I was born in Argentina, and lived here all my life. <br>	
				For a long time I was on the search of that which motivated me, it was a long and harsh search, until my dad offered me to pay for my studies and become a Programmer and Web Developer. At first, I wasn't actually thrilled, until I did my first code. Damn! I still remember the feeling, how proud I was of being able to do a simple line of code, and style it with some corky font and an unrelated icon. After that, I was sure I wanted to become one and devoted myself to learning the ways of HTML and CSS, and many other computer languages and programms, such as GitHub, Jquery, SASS, Javascript and more. <br>
				Im thrilled about this because for the first time I really like and enjoy what I am studying. I had some fail attempts to study Photography and Marketing. <br>
				But this, THIS IS IT! <br>
				<br> I'll try to answer the question above, Who am I? <br>
				<br>
				Well, I'm just another man from Buenos Aires, trying to make a living out of what I like. <br>
        I come from a good family and had a good childhood, despite some minor bullshit that I won't get into. <br>
				I don't want to bore you guys! <br>
				I worked in the entretainment bussines for about 6 years. <br> 
				I've been many things, an experienced barman, a bouncer, but mainly an Event Producer. I started small, working with local event producing agencies, and made my way to the top.<br> 
				I am a very active person, I love sports, mostly soccer and riding my longboard everywhere in town. I also teach longboard to begginers, and for those who are more advanced, slide and freeride with speed. Though I had my fair share of falls and injuries, it is still my favourite sport ever. I also really like to sail, though I haven't done it for a couple of years now.  <br></p></div>
