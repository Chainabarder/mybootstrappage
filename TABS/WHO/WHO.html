			<h1> Who am I? </h1>
			<p> My name is Felix Shaw Sparacino, I was born in Argentina, though i never felt actually an Argentinian. I'm currently studying Front-End Development in CoderHouse. <br>	
				For a long time I was on the search of that which motivated me, it was a long and harsh search, until my dad offered me to pay for my studies and become a Programmer and Web Developer. At first, I wasn't actually thrilled, until I did my first code. Damn! I still remember the feeling, how proud I was of being able to do a simple line of code, and style it with some corky font and an unrelated icon. After that, I was sure I wanted to become one and devoted myself to learning the ways of HTML and CSS, and many other computer languages. <br>
				Im thrilled about this because for the first time I really like and enjoy what I am studying. I had some fail attempts to study Photography and Marketing. <br>
				But this, THIS IS IT! <br>
				I spend a lot of time with my computer, mostly playing videogames like Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, The Fallout Saga, Mount and Blade with mods and The Witcher Saga most of all, mostly Medieval Fantasy RPG's. And now, of course, programming, and learning new languages to improve my skills as a programmer and developer. <br>
				<br> I'll try to answer the question above, Who am I? <br>
				<br>
				Well, I'm just another man from Buenos Aires, trying to make a living out of what I like. I come from a good family and had a good childhood, despite some minor bullshit that I won't get into. <br>
				I don't want to bore you guys! <br>
				I am 28 years old, but I feel older, maybe because of all the shit I went through. I worked in the entretainment bussines for about 6 years. <br> 
				I've been many things, an experienced barman, a bouncer, but mainly an Event Producer. I started small, working with local event producing agencies, and made my way to the top.<br> 
				In 2014 I became the Personnel Manager of CROBAR, the most renowned nightclub in Buenos Aires. And the right hand, of he who booked all the international artists of the best Techno parties. <br>
				I am a very active person, I love sports, mostly soccer and riding my longboard everywhere in town. I also teach longboard to begginers, and for those who are more advanced, slide and freeride with speed. Though I had my fair share of falls and injuries, it is still my favourite sport ever. I also really like to sail, though I haven't done it for a couple of years now.  <br>
				Here's a video of me and my friends doing the sport we love, i hope you enjoy it: </p>
